“And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small café in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.”


Hello, Geniuses!
Could we be nice to each other? 
I am 47yo RealAndiB from Cologne in Germany. Even though i earn my and my familie's Spaghetti Bolgnese by doing database-stuff, i am here to listen and learn. I am interested in [minimalistic] WebDesign and [minimalistic] App-Design and [minimalistic] OS modulation.

Let's be kind!
